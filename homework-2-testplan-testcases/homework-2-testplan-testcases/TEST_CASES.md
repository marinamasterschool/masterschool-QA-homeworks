# TEST CASE DESIGN – MARKET MATE

====================================================
1. PRODUCT RATING SYSTEM
====================================================

Test Design Techniques:
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
- Error Guessing
- Use Case Testing

----------------------------------------------------
TEST CASES
----------------------------------------------------

1. Boundary Value Analysis
- Test Case: Submit rating with minimum allowed value.
  Input: Rating = 1
  Expected Outcome: Rating submitted successfully.

- Test Case: Submit rating with maximum allowed value.
  Input: Rating = 5
  Expected Outcome: Rating submitted successfully.

2. Equivalence Partitioning
- Test Case: Submit rating below valid range.
  Input: Rating = 0
  Expected Outcome: Error message “Invalid rating value.”

- Test Case: Submit rating above valid range.
  Input: Rating = 6
  Expected Outcome: Error message “Invalid rating value.”

3. Error Guessing
- Test Case: Submit rating without selecting stars.
  Input: Rating field empty
  Expected Outcome: “Rating is required.”

- Test Case: Submit rating using invalid characters.
  Input: “five”
  Expected Outcome: “Invalid rating format.”

4. Use Case Testing
- Test Case: Submit rating with a written comment.
  Input: Rating = 4, Comment = “Very good product!”
  Expected Outcome: Rating and comment saved and displayed.

- Test Case: Verify average rating updates correctly.
  Input: Submit new rating
  Expected Outcome: Average rating recalculated and shown correctly.


====================================================
2. AGE VERIFICATION FOR ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS
====================================================

Test Design Techniques:
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
- Error Guessing
- Use Case Testing

----------------------------------------------------
TEST CASES
----------------------------------------------------

1. Boundary Value Analysis
- Test Case: Age exactly 18.
  Input: Age = 18
  Expected Outcome: Access allowed.

- Test Case: Age just below 18.
  Input: Age = 17
  Expected Outcome: Access denied, message “You must be 18+.”

2. Equivalence Partitioning
- Test Case: Age group below 18.
  Input: Age = 15
  Expected Outcome: Access denied.

- Test Case: Age group above 18.
  Input: Age = 25
  Expected Outcome: Access granted.

3. Error Guessing
- Test Case: Age field empty.
  Input: “”
  Expected Outcome: Error “Age is required.”

- Test Case: Invalid age format.
  Input: Age = “abc”
  Expected Outcome: Error “Invalid age format.”

4. Use Case Testing
- Test Case: Age modal appears before accessing Alcohol section.
  Input: Navigate to Alcohol category
  Expected Outcome: Modal appears.

- Test Case: Block access after incorrect age entry.
  Input: Age = 16
  Expected Outcome: User remains blocked from category.

3. SHIPPING COST CHANGES  
====================================================

Rule:
- Orders ≥ 20€ → Free shipping
- Orders < 20€ → Shipping fee applied

Test Design Techniques:
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
- Error Guessing
- Use Case Testing

----------------------------------------------------
TEST CASES 
----------------------------------------------------

1. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**

- Test Case: Order total exactly at free-shipping threshold.
  Input: Cart total = 20.00€
  Expected Outcome: Free shipping applied.

- Test Case: Order total just below threshold.
  Input: Cart total = 19.99€
  Expected Outcome: Shipping fee added.

2. **Equivalence Partitioning**

- Test Case: Valid free-shipping partition.
  Input: Cart total = 35€
  Expected Outcome: Free shipping applied.

- Test Case: Valid shipping-fee partition.
  Input: Cart total = 10€
  Expected Outcome: Shipping fee added.

3. **Error Guessing**

- Test Case: Negative cart total.
  Input: -5€
  Expected Outcome: Error “Invalid cart total.”

- Test Case: Non-numeric cart total.
  Input: “abc”
  Expected Outcome: Error “Invalid amount format.”

- Test Case: Cart total missing
  Input: “” 
  Expected Outcome: Error “Cart total is required.”

4. **Use Case Testing**

- Test Case: Shipping fee updates after removing an item.
  Input: Total becomes < 20€
  Expected Outcome: Shipping fee added.

- Test Case: Shipping becomes free after adding items.
  Input: Total becomes ≥ 20€
  Expected Outcome: Free shipping applied.
